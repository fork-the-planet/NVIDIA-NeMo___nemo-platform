refresh-benchmark-cache.py

Pulls current scores from BFCL (tool-calling) and LMSYS Chatbot Arena
Elo (head-to-head human preference), enriches each model entry with
plain-English capability descriptions, and writes a JSON cache the
nemo-model-selection skill reads.

The skill uses this cache to recommend models in plain English first
and benchmark numbers second.

Usage:
    python scripts/refresh-benchmark-cache.py
    python scripts/refresh-benchmark-cache.py --output path/to/cache.json
    python scripts/refresh-benchmark-cache.py --dry-run

Stdlib only. No third-party dependencies.
