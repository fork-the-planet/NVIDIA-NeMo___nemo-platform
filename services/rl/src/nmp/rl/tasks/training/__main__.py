"""
Training task entry point.

Usage:
    python -m nmp.rl.tasks.training

The runner reads the platform Jobs step config (``NEMO_JOB_STEP_CONFIG_FILE_PATH``),
builds a :class:`~nmp.rl.app.jobs.training.schemas.TrainingStepConfig`, and runs
the :class:`~nmp.rl.tasks.training.runner.TrainingRunner`.

In distributed (multi-node) training, all pods run this entry point.
The DistributedContext handles role detection and coordination:
- Rank 0 (coordinator): Runs all phases, reports progress
- Rank > 0 (workers): Participate in training, wait at barriers
