"""Schemas for the unsloth training task configuration.

The training step config is a thin wrapper around the canonical
:class:`~nmp.unsloth.schemas.UnslothJobOutput` plus the resolved
filesystem paths the file_io download step writes to. The container
runner reads this from the platform Jobs envelope, validates it, and
hands the job spec + paths to :func:`~nmp.unsloth.tasks.training.backends.unsloth_sft.train_sft`.
