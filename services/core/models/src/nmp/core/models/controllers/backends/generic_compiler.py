"""Backend-agnostic compiler for the ``generic`` engine.

The ``generic`` engine runs an arbitrary container as-is: there is no
inference-engine compiler synthesizing args or env. The deployment declares a
container image + tag, a readiness-probe path, and (optionally) raw args and
environment variables; the platform runs the image and probes it.

Like :mod:`vllm_compiler`, these functions take a :class:`DeploymentConfigView`
and return plain data (image tuple, arg vector, env dict). They are NOT specific
to any service backend: the docker backend renders the result into a
``docker run`` container; the k8s backend renders it into a native Kubernetes
Deployment. Keep this module free of backend-specific imports so both can reuse
it.

Unlike the vLLM/NIM engines there is no platform-default image for a generic
container, so :func:`resolve_generic_image` raises when ``image_name`` is unset.
The create/update API layer validates this up front; the compiler enforces it
again as a defensive backstop.
