"""Backend-agnostic engine dispatch + readiness-probe helpers.

The ``engine`` discriminant on a ``ModelDeploymentConfig`` selects the compiler
path (nim / vllm / generic). These constants and helpers are shared by every
service backend (docker container labels, k8s object labels) so engine selection
and readiness-probe resolution behave identically regardless of where the
deployment runs.
