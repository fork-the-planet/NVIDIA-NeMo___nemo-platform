"""Auth service seeding logic.

This module handles bootstrapping authorization data such as:

- Platform admin role binding (from NMP_AUTH_ADMIN_EMAIL)
- Wildcard principal (*) bindings for default workspace access

Idempotency:
    All seeding operations are idempotent and safe to run concurrently across
    multiple instances. The pattern used is "create-and-handle-conflict":

    1. Attempt to create the entity
    2. If EntityConflictError (already exists), treat as success
    3. If other error, log warning and continue

    This approach is preferred over "check-then-create" because it avoids
    race conditions where multiple instances might simultaneously see the
    entity as missing and attempt to create it.
