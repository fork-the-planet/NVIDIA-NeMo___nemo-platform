    that evaluation then narrows the candidate set exactly.

    ``None`` means "no store constraint" (accept all jobs in scope) — always a

    - Status comparison -> None. Replacing a constraint with "accept all" only
      widens.
    - Non-status comparison -> itself. Status-independent, so it is exact and
      safe to push verbatim.
    - ``$and`` -> AND of the children's supersets (children that relax to None
      are dropped). Any row satisfying the original AND satisfies every child,
      hence every child-superset, hence their AND. Dropping a None child only
      removes a constraint.
    - ``$or`` -> OR of the children's supersets, UNLESS any child relaxes to
      None, in which case the whole OR relaxes to None (an unconstrained branch
      makes the union unconstrained). Each child-superset is a superset of its
      child, so the OR of supersets is a superset of the OR of children.
    - ``$not`` -> kept verbatim only when its operand is status-free (then the
      whole negation is exact and status-independent). If the operand references
      status, negation can invert sub/superset relationships, so we relax the
      entire ``$not`` to None and let the in-memory pass do the work.
