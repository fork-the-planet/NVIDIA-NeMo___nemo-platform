"""Secrets API schemas.

The request/response contract lives in ``nemo_platform_plugin.secrets.types`` —
the shared single source of truth imported by both the server (here) and the
typed ``SecretsClient``. This module re-exports those models and adds the
server-only ``from_entity`` conversion helpers.
