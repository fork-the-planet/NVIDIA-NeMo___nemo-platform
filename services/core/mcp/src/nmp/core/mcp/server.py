"""Platform MCP server aggregator for NeMo Platform.

This module provides the main MCP server that aggregates all service-specific
MCP servers into a unified interface for AI agents. It follows the same pattern
as the REST API platform aggregator, where each service owns its own MCP tools
and the platform composes them all together.

Architecture:
    services/core/entities/mcp/     -> Workspace tools (list_workspaces, etc.)
    services/core/jobs/mcp/         -> Job monitoring tools (future)
    services/core/models/mcp/       -> Model discovery tools (future)
    services/core/mcp/              -> This aggregator (composes all above)

This enables:
- 1:1 mapping of service:MCP server (matches REST API architecture)
- Each service can be deployed with its own MCP server
- Platform can compose them all for unified deployment
- Code maintainers can see clear service boundaries
