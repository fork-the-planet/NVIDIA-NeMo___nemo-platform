# NeMo Platform Setup

Get a local NeMo platform running on `localhost:8080`. Work through the prereq questions below before bootstrapping — they shape which services start and what state survives the run. When setup is finished, [What's next?](#whats-next) maps the user's stated goal to the right follow-up skill.

> This document is the canonical setup guide at `skills/nemo-setup/SKILL.md`. Unlike the other skills, it is **not** installed by `nemo skills install` — it has to be available before the platform is bootstrapped, when the CLI may not yet exist.

## Question 1 — Is a NeMo platform already running locally?

Before starting `nemo services run`, check for an existing instance:

```bash
lsof -iTCP:8080 -sTCP:LISTEN
ps -ef | grep "nemo services run" | grep -v grep
```

Alternatively, probe the API with `nemo workspaces list` — a workspaces table back means the platform is up. **Don't `curl /v1/workspaces`** to check; that path returns 404 even when the platform is healthy.

If port 8080 is in use **or** a `nemo services run` process exists, do not silently start a new one — the new instance will fail to bind, and it gets confusing which platform is answering requests (the controller piece can still partially start and connect to the old API on `:8080`, producing logs that look like a fresh boot but are reading state from the old DB). Surface the exact PIDs and command line, then ask which path the user wants:

- **(a) Kill the running platform and start fresh.** Use this when the running process is stale (long-running, crashed, or pre-dates the changes the user is now making). Procedure:
  1. SIGTERM the exact PIDs — `kill <pid> [<pid>...]`
  2. Wait ~10s; if still alive, **re-verify** each PID still matches a `nemo services run` command (paranoid check against PID reuse), then SIGKILL only those exact PIDs.
  3. Only **after** the processes are gone, wipe the DB (see Question 3).
- **(b) Keep it running and skip setup.** Use the running platform as-is — skip Switchyard install / DB wipe / startup entirely and proceed straight to your task. Caveats:
  - Middleware plugins like `nemo-switchyard` are loaded at platform **startup**, so a VirtualModel that needs middleware the running platform did not load will fail. Confirm the loaded plugins by grepping the platform log for `Loaded inference middleware plugin` before assuming a middleware is available. The first VirtualModel create with `nemo-switchyard` either succeeds or returns `422 references unknown plugin 'nemo-switchyard'`; a 422 means restart is needed.
  - The running services should include what the task needs: `inference-gateway`, `secrets`, `models`, `entities`, plus `guardrails` if the task uses rails. There is no public "list running services" endpoint — infer from feature attempts (`nemo guardrail configs list` returning 404 means the guardrails service isn't loaded).
  - The user may already have the workspace / secret / provider seeded — check with `nemo workspaces list`, `nemo secrets list --workspace …`, and `nemo inference providers list --workspace …` before re-creating anything (creates may 409).
- **(c) Abort and let the user investigate.**

> ⚠️ **macOS unlinked-inode gotcha:** running `rm -rf ~/.local/share/nemo` while a `nemo services run` process is still alive does **not** reset state. The files get unlinked from the directory tree but the running process keeps writing to its open inode, and a freshly-spawned platform will see the on-disk file (a new, empty inode) while the old process still owns the data. Always kill the platform process **first**, then wipe the DB.

## Question 2 — Local data directory?

Confirm where the user wants local platform state (entity-store DB, encryption key, files-service uploads) persisted. Use the same prompt language as `nemo setup`:

> **Local data directory:** `~/.local/share/nemo`

Most users accept the default. Override paths follow XDG conventions:

1. **`$NMP_DATA_DIR`** (most explicit) — used as-is, no `/nemo` suffix appended.
2. **`$XDG_DATA_HOME/nemo`** — if `XDG_DATA_HOME` is set in the shell.
3. **`~/.local/share/nemo`** — the default.

If the user picks a custom path, export it before starting services so the spawned platform inherits it:

```bash
export NMP_DATA_DIR=/custom/path/to/state
```

`nemo setup` persists the choice to `~/.config/nmp/config.yaml` under `local_services.data_dir` and re-uses it on subsequent runs. If you're running services manually (not via `nemo setup`), set `NMP_DATA_DIR` yourself each session.

## Question 3 — Wipe the local DB?

Ask whether the user wants to wipe the local entity-store database before platform startup. Warn clearly that this deletes local platform state, including secret metadata and the local encryption key. Providers/secrets must be re-seeded afterward. If the database and encryption key get out of sync, later runs can fail with decryption errors such as `cryptography.exceptions.InvalidTag`. **The wipe only works if no `nemo services run` process is currently holding the file open** (see the macOS gotcha under Question 1). If the user confirms, run this before `nemo services run`:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.local/share/nemo
```

Replace the path with whatever was chosen in Q2 (`$NMP_DATA_DIR`, `$XDG_DATA_HOME/nemo`, or the default `~/.local/share/nemo`).

## Bootstrap and start

The README documents the streamlined path. Prefer this over the manual steps below whenever the task fits — it covers prerequisites install, service startup, provider registration, default-model selection, and demo agent deployment in one shot:

```bash
make bootstrap           # installs Python deps, Studio assets, and plugins (including demo calculator agent)
source .venv/bin/activate
nemo setup               # interactive: prompts for provider, picks default model, optionally deploys calculator-agent
```

Non-interactive equivalent (useful for CI / agent-driven invocations):

```bash
export NVIDIA_API_KEY=nvapi...
nemo setup --auto --start-services --install-skills --deploy-agent
```

`make bootstrap` is the umbrella for three finer-grained targets — use these if you only need a subset:

| Target | What it does |
|---|---|
| `make bootstrap-python` | Creates `.venv` and runs `uv sync` (Python deps + workspace packages) |
| `make bootstrap-studio` | Installs web deps via `pnpm` and builds Studio assets for FastAPI |

`make clean` removes the venv; `make clean-python` is the venv-only variant.

If `nemo setup` is too high-level for the task (e.g. debugging startup, custom service set, custom plugin install after bootstrap), use the manual sections below.

### Default model selection (under `--auto`)

`$NEMO_DEFAULT_MODEL` **must be a hyphenated entity ID** from `nemo models list` (e.g. `nvidia-llama-3-3-nemotron-super-49b-v1-5` or `default/nvidia-llama-3-3-nemotron-super-49b-v1-5`). The slash-with-dots form (`nvidia/llama-3.3-nemotron-super-49b-v1-5`) is the upstream catalog's `served_model_name` — it's shown for human display but the gateway rejects it as a request input.

`nemo setup --auto` picks the default model in this order:

1. `$NEMO_DEFAULT_MODEL` (if set) — used as-is. The user may have exported this from a previous session; it takes precedence over anything discovered from the registered provider.
2. Otherwise, the first model entity returned by provider discovery.

If the user is surprised by which model got picked, check `echo $NEMO_DEFAULT_MODEL` first — that's the most common cause.

The first-discovered fallback is intentionally simple — providers like NVIDIA Build expose dozens of models and "first one" rarely matches the user's intent. If the user wants a specific model as the default (or wants to compare options before committing), don't rely on the `--auto` fallback. After setup finishes, the `inference` skill's "Step 2 — Discover available models" enumerates entity IDs and shows the jq filters for picking one out by vendor or family. The user can then pin their choice via `export NEMO_DEFAULT_MODEL=<workspace>/<entity-id>` or by overriding `body["model"]` per request.

If `nemo agents invoke …` fails with HTTP 422 in under a second on the first call, the cause is almost always a slash-with-dots model name reaching the gateway (e.g. via a stale `NEMO_DEFAULT_MODEL` or an agent config that hardcoded the upstream catalog form). The `inference` skill's "Common failure: HTTP 422 from chat completion" subsection has the diagnose-and-recover steps — don't conclude the platform is broken.

### Starting the platform (without Switchyard)

If `make bootstrap` has already run, just start the services. `nemo setup` does this for you; the manual equivalent is:

```bash
uv run nemo services run \
  --services entities,models,inference-gateway,secrets \
  --controllers models
```

### Starting the platform with Switchyard middleware

`make bootstrap-python` and bare `uv sync` install `plugins/nemo-switchyard` through the root workspace's `enabled-plugins` group. The Switchyard library is vendored in-tree at `plugins/nemo-switchyard/vendor/switchyard/` (a snapshot pinned in `tool.uv.sources`) — no separate Switchyard checkout, `SWITCHYARD_PATH` env var, or PyPI workaround is needed. Start with debug logging to see routing decisions:

```bash
# Start with LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG to see routing decisions.
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG uv run nemo services run \
  --services entities,models,inference-gateway,secrets \
  --controllers models
```

`nemo-switchyard` is auto-discovered via its `nemo.inference_middleware` entry point once dependencies are installed.

### Demo agent

`make bootstrap` installs the NeMo agents plugin and the calculator-agent example through the root workspace, so no separate `uv pip install` is needed. After services start, `nemo setup` (or `nemo setup --auto --deploy-agent`) will deploy a demo `calculator-agent` in the default workspace. Verify with:

```bash
nemo agents list
nemo agents invoke --agent calculator-agent --input "What is 12 * 8?"
```

### Local platform environment summary

- **Port**: `8080` (CLI default — do NOT pass a custom `--base-url`).
- **`export NMP_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080` — required when targeting a local platform.** If your `~/.config/nmp/config.yaml` already points at a remote cluster, the CLI uses that base URL and ignores the local platform entirely. Setting this env var overrides the config file for the current shell session.
- **Reset state:** `rm -rf ~/.local/share/nemo` (only with platform stopped — see the gotcha above).

## What's next?

The platform is running. Don't leave the user with "you're good to go" — offer a menu of what they can do next based on what they originally asked for. Match the user's intent to one of the patterns from the [README's "Coding agent integration" section](/README.md#coding-agent-integration):

| User says… | Goal | Follow-up skill |
|---|---|---|
| "Optimize my agent", "my agent is too slow / using too many tokens" | Cost / latency optimization via routing or skill tuning | `nemo-agents-optimize` |
| "Secure my agent", "my agent is producing dangerous output" | Content safety / red-team / leak audit | `nemo-agents-secure`, `nemo-guardrails`, `nemo-auditor` |
| "Can my agent use multiple models?", "split traffic across N backends" | Multi-backend routing via Switchyard | (inline; see `inference` skill) |
| "Evaluate my model / agent on \<benchmark\>" | Eval against a dataset / harness | `nemo-evaluator`, `evaluator-plugin` |
| "Generate synthetic data", "I have sensitive data and need…" | Data generation / anonymization / safe synthesis | `data-designer`, `nemo-anonymizer`, `nemo-safe-synthesizer` |
| "Just deploy / invoke an agent" | Deploy the demo calculator agent or your own | `nemo-agents-optimize` (later, if needed) |
| "Chat with a model", "call \<model\> via inference" | Plain inference through IGW | `inference` skill |
| "Register an inference provider" (no further use case) | Provider registration only | `inference` skill |

If the user's prompt doesn't already pin one down, ask: *"The platform is up. What would you like to do next — optimize an agent, deploy one, run inference, evaluate, generate data, or something else?"*

If the user wants to **pick or swap the default model** (e.g. they didn't like the one `--auto` selected, or they want to compare options), don't guess — hand off to the `inference` skill. Step 2 there enumerates `served_models[].model_entity_id` and shows jq filters for picking by vendor / family. To pin the choice for subsequent runs, export `NEMO_DEFAULT_MODEL=<workspace>/<entity-id>` before the next `nemo setup --auto`. For one-off commands, pass the entity ID positionally: `nemo chat <entity-id>`.

### Available skills

`nemo skills list` is the canonical check for what's actually loaded — the entries depend on which plugins are installed. Expected entries after `make bootstrap`:

CLI built-ins (always present):

- **`inference`** — ModelProvider + VirtualModel + Switchyard reference. End-to-end inference flow, routing patterns, middleware ordering, troubleshooting.

> Setup lives at `skills/nemo-setup/SKILL.md` rather than as a CLI-installable skill, since coding agents need it before the platform is bootstrapped.

Plugin-provided (appear once the plugin is installed):

- **`nemo-agents-optimize`** — optimize a deployed agent (routing splits, skill tuning, prompt tuning, evals against newer models). From `plugins/nemo-agents`.
- **`nemo-agents-secure`** — audit a deployed agent for missing guardrails, PII exposure, leaked secrets/keys. From `plugins/nemo-agents`.
- **`nemo-guardrails`** — guardrail config CRUD, content-safety rails, the `nemo-guardrails` middleware. From `plugins/nemo-guardrails`.
- **`nemo-auditor`** — vulnerability scanning, audit configs/targets/jobs, red-team probes. From `plugins/nemo-auditor`.
- **`nemo-evaluator`** / **`evaluator-plugin`** — metrics, sync/async evaluations, llm-judge, benchmark jobs. From `plugins/nemo-evaluator`.
- **`data-designer`** — synthetic dataset generation pipelines. From `plugins/nemo-data-designer`.
- **`nemo-entities`**, **`nemo-files`**, **`nemo-secrets`**, **`nemo-auth`**, **`nemo-inference-gateway`** — CLI references for the matching services.

### Installing skills into the coding agent on demand

`nemo skills list` lists every skill the **platform** can install — but that's not the same as what's currently loaded in the coding agent (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, OpenCode). After `make bootstrap` finishes, the relevant subset must still be **installed into the coding agent** for it to actually use them.

Default flow (already wired into `nemo setup`):

```bash
nemo skills install --agent <claude|cursor|codex|opencode>
```

With no `--skill` flag, this installs **all** skills from `nemo skills list` into the chosen agent. Run it again any time `nemo skills list` changes (new plugin installed, plugin updated).

If the user's goal in the table above maps to a skill that you (the coding agent) don't currently have in this session, install only the skills you need rather than all of them:

```bash
# Single skill
nemo skills install --agent claude --skill nemo-agents-optimize

# Multiple skills
nemo skills install --agent claude --skill nemo-agents-secure --skill nemo-guardrails
```

Then invoke the freshly-installed skill — e.g. ask the user "I just installed the `nemo-agents-optimize` skill; want me to use it to walk through optimizing your agent now?"

If a goal-relevant skill is **missing from `nemo skills list` entirely**, the plugin that ships it isn't installed. Install the plugin first, then re-run `nemo skills install`:

```bash
uv pip install -e plugins/<plugin-name>
nemo skills install --agent <agent>            # picks up the new skill(s)
```
