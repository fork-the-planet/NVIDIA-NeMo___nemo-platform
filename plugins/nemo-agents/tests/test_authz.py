"""Authorization derivation for the agents plugin.

Asserts that every mounted route carries a valid ``@path_rule`` whose permissions all
share the ``agents`` namespace (so ``_derive_service_contribution`` reports no problems
and derives the catalog from the routes), and spot-checks the shapes that matter: a CRUD
binding, the gateway proxy binding (PRINCIPAL + ``agents.gateway.invoke`` across the
wildcard path and every proxied method), and a job-factory binding.
