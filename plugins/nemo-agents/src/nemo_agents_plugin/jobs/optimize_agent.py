"""OptimizeAgentJob — optimize a NAT agent workflow via prompt/parameter tuning.

Registered under the ``nemo.jobs`` entry-point group as ``agents.optimize``.

Optimization is provided by the ``nvidia-nat-core`` package (parameter
optimization, profiling) and optionally ``nvidia-nat-nemo-customizer``
(fine-tuning orchestration).  This job delegates to the ``nat optimize``
CLI subprocess so it remains decoupled from the optimization Python APIs.

The job runs in the ``cpu-tasks`` container since the optimization
orchestration itself is CPU-only; the agent processes and LLM inference
APIs run elsewhere.

Resolution model
----------------

The ``agent`` field accepts three shapes:

* :class:`~nemo_agents_plugin.refs.AgentRef` — a platform-managed name
  (``"react-agent"`` or ``"workspace/react-agent"``).  The job fetches
  the agent's stored NAT config from the platform, merges it with the
  user-supplied optimize config (workflow/functions/telemetry from the
  agent; eval/optimizer/judge LLMs and any tuning overrides on shared
  LLM keys from the optimize side — see
  :func:`~nemo_agents_plugin.utils.merge_agent_config`), and runs
  ``nat optimize`` locally with the merged file.  The workflow runs
  in-process; LLM calls route through the Inference Gateway via the
  same URL injection used by deployed agents.  This is the path that
  makes per-trial ``temperature`` / ``top_p`` sweeps actually take
  effect on the agent's behaviour, since each trial gets its own
  in-process workflow built from the trial-specific config.
* :class:`~nemo_platform_plugin.refs.EndpointURL` — a literal HTTP(S) URL.
  Forwarded to ``nat optimize --endpoint`` verbatim and treated as an
  opaque service.  Useful for non-platform agent servers, but be aware
  that LLM hyperparameter sweeps in the optimize config are *local* to
  the optimizer process and never reach the remote agent — every trial
  evaluates the same remote behaviour.  This mode is preserved for
  backward compatibility and for non-platform deployments.
* ``None`` — the optimize config is expected to declare an inline
  workflow itself (no agent fetch, no merge, no ``--endpoint``).

Before invoking ``nat optimize`` (in any of the three modes) the
config's LLMs are injected with the platform Inference Gateway URL via
``setdefault`` semantics, so agents and optimize configs can omit
``base_url``/``api_key`` and route through the IGW automatically.
