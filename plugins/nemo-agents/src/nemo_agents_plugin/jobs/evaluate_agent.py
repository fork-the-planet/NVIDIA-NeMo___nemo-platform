"""EvaluateAgentJob — evaluate a NAT agent workflow against a dataset.

Registered under the ``nemo.jobs`` entry-point group as ``agents.evaluate``.

Evaluation is provided by the ``nvidia-nat-eval`` package alongside the
``nvidia-nat-core`` runtime.  This job delegates to the ``nat eval`` CLI
subprocess so it remains decoupled from any specific eval Python API, which
lives in ``nvidia-nat-eval``.

The job is dispatched by the platform's host subprocess executor — there is
no dedicated container image.  ``nat eval`` is resolved from the workspace
venv where ``nvidia-nat-eval`` is installed alongside ``nemo-agents-plugin``.

Before invoking ``nat eval``, the eval config's judge LLMs are injected with
the platform Inference Gateway URL (same ``setdefault`` semantics as agent
deployments), so eval configs can omit ``base_url`` and route through the IGW
automatically.

    Field declaration order also drives the auto-generated CLI flag
    order — keep the most-frequently-set knobs first.

    Attributes:
        agent: The agent to evaluate against.  Accepts either a
            platform-managed agent reference (``"name"`` or
            ``"workspace/name"``) or a literal HTTP(S) endpoint URL.  The
            shape is auto-detected at run time — values containing
            ``"://"`` are treated as URLs (and forwarded to
            ``nat eval --endpoint`` verbatim); anything else is resolved
            to the platform gateway URL
            ``{base_url}/apis/agents/v2/workspaces/{workspace}/agents/{name}/-``.
            When ``None`` the eval config is expected to include an
            inline agent workflow.
        eval_config: Path to the NAT evaluation YAML config file.  When
            ``eval_config_fileset`` is set, this is interpreted relative
            to the downloaded fileset's contents.
        eval_config_fileset: Optional fileset reference (``name`` or
            ``workspace/name``) that pre-stages the eval YAML and any
            sibling files (e.g. dataset).  Used by platform-managed
            submissions where the ``agents.evaluate-agent`` function
            uploads everything before submitting; local CLI runs leave
            this ``None`` and let ``eval_config`` be a real local path.
        output: Where to put the eval outputs.  Accepts either a local
            directory path (``./out``, ``/abs/out``, ``~/out``) or an
            NeMo Platform fileset reference (``"name"`` or ``"workspace/name"``).
            Path-shaped values write directly to disk; bare names upload
            results to the named fileset, creating it on demand.  When
            ``None`` the job writes to ``ctx.storage.persistent /
            "results"`` — the platform-injected persistent volume in
            container runs, a tempdir under ``$TMPDIR`` for local CLI
            runs.
        workspace: NeMo Platform workspace used to scope gateway URL injection,
            ``--agent`` resolution, and ``--output`` fileset creation
            when those values are given as bare names.

        Same entry point on both local CLI and the platform container; the

        :meth:`_resolve_eval_config` downloads the fileset's contents into a
        tempdir before running ``nat eval``; when it isn't, ``cfg.eval_config``
        is used as a real local path.

        The resolved eval config is preprocessed to inject the Inference
        Gateway URL into any judge LLMs that do not already have ``base_url``
        set.  A temporary copy is written to the same directory as the
        original so that relative paths (e.g. dataset ``file_path``) continue
        to resolve.

        ``nat eval`` failures skip the fileset upload — the
        :class:`subprocess.CalledProcessError` propagates out through
        ``_resolve_output``'s except-clause (which clears ``should_upload``)
        before being translated into a ``"failed"`` status return.

                (in-container) from the ambient SDK handle.  Required when
                ``cfg.eval_config_fileset`` or a fileset-shaped ``cfg.output``
                is set (download / upload respectively); a local-directory
                output runs without it, so the parameter is declared optional
                and validated at the point of use.
            ctx: Runtime context bound by signature DI.  Both
                :class:`~nemo_platform_plugin.scheduler.NemoJobScheduler.run_local`
                and :func:`~nemo_platform_plugin.tasks.dispatcher.run_task`
