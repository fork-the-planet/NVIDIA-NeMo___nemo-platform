"""Agent gateway proxy routes.

Two proxy routes:

``/v2/workspaces/{workspace}/agents/{name}/-/{trailing_uri}``
    Proxy by **agent name** — gateway resolves the active deployment and
    forwards the request.  This is the primary user-facing path, analogous to
    how IGW routes by model name.

``/v2/workspaces/{workspace}/deployments/{name}/-/{trailing_uri}``
    Proxy by **deployment name** — for direct targeting of a specific
    deployment (e.g. A/B testing).

The ``/-/`` separator prevents URL conflicts with the CRUD routes
(``/agents/{name}`` and ``/deployments/{name}``).  This mirrors the pattern
used by the Inference Gateway.

Streaming and SSE are supported: the response is streamed back to the client
chunk by chunk.  ``text/event-stream`` responses bypass buffering.
