This module provides helpers to store and inject request-scoped headers
into cached ``LLMRails`` instances and their LangChain clients.

Each IGW request leases an ``LLMRails`` instance from the cache, runs the
configured rails, then returns the instance to the pool. The leased instance
already owns LangChain clients used for calls to the guardrail models.

Since the LangChain client for an ``LLMRails`` instance is reused by later requests,
request-specific service-principal and tracing headers cannot be stored on the client
when constructing the ``LLMRails`` instance: the next request may need different
headers while using the same client object. This module stores the current request's
headers in a ``ContextVar`` and merges them into each outbound ``ChatNVIDIA`` call
to a guardrail model.

    Model calls happen deep inside nemoguardrails/LangChain library code that
    does not receive IGW's middleware context object. ``ContextVar`` gives those
    calls access to request-scoped headers without adding mutable request data
    on the cached LangChain client itself.

    Args:
        sdk: The SDK whose forwarding headers should be propagated.
            For per-request auth, pass a request-scoped SDK built via
            ``sdk.with_options(set_default_headers=...)``.

    The data flow is:

    1. ``get_forwarding_headers(sdk)`` extracts the per-request
       service-principal, on-behalf-of, and tracing headers.
    2. This context manager stores them in ``_request_headers_ctx`` for the
       current execution context.
    3. Non-streaming rails run via ``asyncio.to_thread``; Python copies the
       caller task's context into the worker thread, and ``run_until_complete``
       schedules ``LLMRails.generate_async`` as a task with that copied context.
    4. Streaming rails enter this context inside the returned async generator
       before iterating ``LLMRails.stream_async``, so the active task context
       stays in scope while chunks are produced.
    5. When LangChain prepares an outbound model request, our
       ``_prepare_inputs_and_payload`` override reads ``_request_headers_ctx``
       and merges those headers into the request.
