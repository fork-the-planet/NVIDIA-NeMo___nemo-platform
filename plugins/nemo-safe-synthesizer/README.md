# Run Safe Synthesizer Locally

Use the Safe Synthesizer plugin to run a job on a host GPU while preserving the platform `safe-synthesizer` API prefix.

## Prerequisites

- A CUDA-capable host with compatible NVIDIA drivers.
- The Safe Synthesizer plugin installed as a local editable plugin.
- The separate Safe Synthesizer runtime venv created with the engine/CUDA dependencies.
- A Safe Synthesizer job spec, such as `nss-job.json`.
- A running platform only if you use platform filesets, Jobs APIs, or `pretrained_model_job`. Pure `run-local` with `--data-source` does not require it.

## Steps

=== "Managed local subprocess"

    1. Sync the workspace and install this plugin outside the root lock:

       ```bash
       BOOTSTRAP_LOCAL_PLUGIN_DIRS=plugins/nemo-safe-synthesizer make bootstrap-python
       ```

    2. Create the separate runtime venv with the NSS engine/CUDA dependencies:

       ```bash
       uv run nemo safe-synthesizer runtime setup
       ```

    3. (Optional, platform jobs only) After `curl -s http://localhost:8080/health/ready`, register model filesets:

       ```bash
       uv run python plugins/nemo-safe-synthesizer/scripts/setup_model_filesets.py --files-api-url http://localhost:8080
       ```

    4. Run the job locally through the public plugin CLI:

       ```bash
       uv run nemo safe-synthesizer run-local \
         --workspace default \
         --spec-file nss-job.json \
         --data-source ./input.csv \
         --output-dir ./nss-output
       ```

=== "Direct local task"

    1. Sync the workspace, install this plugin outside the root lock, and create the runtime venv:

       ```bash
       BOOTSTRAP_LOCAL_PLUGIN_DIRS=plugins/nemo-safe-synthesizer make bootstrap-python
       uv run nemo safe-synthesizer runtime setup
       ```

    2. Run the task module directly with the configured runtime Python:

       ```bash
       $(uv run nemo safe-synthesizer runtime info | awk -F': ' '/^python:/ {print $2}') \
         -m nemo_safe_synthesizer_plugin.tasks.safe_synthesizer run-local \
         --workspace default \
         --spec-file nss-job.json \
         --data-source ./input.csv \
         --output-dir ./nss-output
       ```

The command writes generated data, summaries, and any adapter output under `./nss-output`.

## Troubleshooting

- If model downloads fail, confirm the Files API URL is reachable and the model filesets exist in the selected workspace.
- If CUDA initialization fails, run `uv run nemo safe-synthesizer runtime info` and verify the runtime package matches the installed driver/runtime.
- If the job cannot load input data, pass `--data-source` with a local file or confirm the fileset reference in the job spec.
