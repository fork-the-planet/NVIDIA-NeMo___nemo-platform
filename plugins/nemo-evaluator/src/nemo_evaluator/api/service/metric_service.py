"""Service layer for stored metric operations.

Combines the Entity Store (the queryable index) with the Files service (the
canonical serialized bundle). The service owns the bundle's storage lifecycle.

Stored metrics are immutable: they can be created, read, listed, and deleted,
but not updated in place. Each bundle upload lands in its own uniquely-named
fileset, which makes every write/rollback target exactly one metric's bytes. As
a result no failure mode leaves a metric pointing at the wrong or missing data —
the worst case is an orphaned fileset (a storage leak), never a corrupted metric:

- create: upload first, then create the entity. On a name conflict (or any
  index failure) we delete the fileset we just created — never another
  metric's. The entity is only created once its bundle exists.
- delete: delete the entity first, then its fileset.
