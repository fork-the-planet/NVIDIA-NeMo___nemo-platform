"""Filter dependency helper for auditor list endpoints.

``make_filter_obj_dep`` parses ``filter[field]=value`` deepObject query params
into a validated dict.  On an unknown filter key it raises a raw
:class:`pydantic.ValidationError` (``NemoFilter`` is ``extra="forbid"``), which
FastAPI surfaces as a 500.  These endpoints wrap that dependency so a misspelled
or unsupported filter key fails loudly with a 422 instead — typos must not be
silently swallowed.
