"""Typed permission vocabulary for the deployments plugin's routes.

Three sub-namespaces under ``deployments`` (one per entity collection). Route handlers
reference these constants in their ``@path_rule``; the platform derives the permission
catalog from the routes, so there is no parallel list to keep in sync. The controller-only
status routes mint a ``status.update`` permission under the collection they project onto.
