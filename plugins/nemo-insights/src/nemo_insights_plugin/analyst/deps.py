"""Run-time dependencies shared by the analyst agent and its tools.

A single :class:`AnalystDeps` instance is threaded through every tool call via
Pydantic AI's :class:`~pydantic_ai.RunContext`, replacing the per-function NAT
config classes. The CLI builds it from its flags; tools read it off
``ctx.deps``. Keeping it in its own module avoids an import cycle between the
agent definition and the tool modules it registers.

class AnalystDeps:
    """Per-run configuration injected into every analyst tool.

    Every tool talks to the platform through a single :class:`AnalystBackend`
    built once by the CLI and shared here, rather than constructing an SDK
    client per call. The CLI owns the backend's client lifecycle (closing it
    when the run finishes), so tools must not close it.

    Attributes:
        agent: Agent under test. Used as the default ``agent_name`` filter for
            span/insight tools.
        workspace: NMP workspace the analyst operates in.
        base_url: Base URL of the running NMP instance (run metadata; tools go
            through ``backend``).
        insights_output: When set, the backend persists insights to this local
            YAML file instead of the Insights plugin API (run metadata).
        backend: Shared data-access backend used by every tool.
        since: Optional lower bound for scheduled incremental analysis. Backend
            reads enforce this even if the model omits a time filter.
        max_results: Hard ceiling on items any single fetch may pull across
            pages. A fetch's ``limit`` is clamped to this so a wide filter
            can't flood the model's context; the analyst paginates or narrows
            its filter to see more.
