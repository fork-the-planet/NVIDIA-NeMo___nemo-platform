"""Pure wall-clock schedule math for periodic insights analysis.

This module is intentionally dependency-free (stdlib only) so the scheduling
logic is unit-testable in isolation. The operator configures an intended local
hour plus an IANA timezone; conversion to UTC happens here at evaluation time so
runs fire at the intended local hour even across DST transitions.
