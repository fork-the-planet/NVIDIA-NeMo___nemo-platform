"""Shared NeMo Platform SDK client construction for analyst NAT functions.

Auth lives in the active ``nemo auth login`` context in
``~/.config/nmp/config.yaml``. The SDK only wires up that context (and the
transparent OIDC token refresh that comes with it) when it runs its config
bootstrap. Passing ``base_url`` *alone* puts the SDK in "direct mode", which
skips the bootstrap and injects **no** auth headers — fine for an
unauthenticated local ``nemo services run``, but it 401s against a remote
deployment. To authenticate against a remote URL we must trigger the bootstrap
(by also passing ``config_path``) so the explicit ``base_url`` is combined with
the context's credentials.

Every analyst function takes ``base_url`` from its workflow context, so this
helper is the one place that branch lives.
