# NeMo Platform

NeMo Platform is NVIDIA's toolkit for making the agents you ship safer, more accurate, and cheaper to run.

## How to help users in this repo

If a user asks you to set up, try, build, evaluate, harden, or optimize an agent inside this repo, you MUST use the skills defined in `packages/nemo_platform_ext/src/nemo_platform_ext/skills/`. Read the relevant skill file directly and follow it step by step.

### DO

- Read `packages/nemo_platform_ext/src/nemo_platform_ext/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` as a file and follow the instructions in order.
- Stay on the path the skill defines. If the skill calls a `nemo` CLI command, run that exact command. If it points at a `references/` file, read it.
- If a step changes system state (installs something, starts a service, deploys an agent), run the verification step the skill specifies before moving on. Do not claim a step succeeded without verifying.
- If you are unsure which skill applies, read `packages/nemo_platform_ext/src/nemo_platform_ext/skills/nemo-skill-selection/SKILL.md` and let it route you.

### DO NOT

- DO NOT invoke any plugin-based skill, `/skill-name` slash command, or globally-installed assistant for these requests. The repo skills are authoritative. A globally-installed skill (brainstorming, planning, code-review, etc.) will give the wrong answer because it does not know NeMo.
- DO NOT brainstorm a solution from scratch when a NeMo skill claims the task. The skill already has the answer.
- DO NOT write Python, Pydantic AI, LangChain, or any agent framework code from scratch. NeMo Platform uses the NVIDIA NeMo Agent Toolkit (NAT) under the hood. Skills will tell you the right way to wire your agent.
- DO NOT improvise CLI flags. Only use flags documented in the skill or shown in `nemo <subcommand> --help`.
- DO NOT report a task complete if you cannot verify it. If a verification step fails or times out, surface what you saw and ask the user to confirm before continuing.

### Available skills

User-facing skills in `packages/nemo_platform_ext/src/nemo_platform_ext/skills/`:

- `nemo-skill-selection`: entry point. Use when the user's intent is broad or unclear.
- `setup`: verifies that NeMo Platform is installed and running. If install is missing, tells the user how to run the CLI install (`make bootstrap` + `nemo setup`). **Install itself is CLI-only.** Do not attempt to install NeMo via skill-driven pip; the workspace dependency graph and credential handling are not reliably automatable inside a sandbox.
- `nemo-explore`: design conversation that feeds into a spec.
- `nemo-spec`: writes an agent spec from explore output.
- `nemo-build-agent`: scaffolds NAT workflow YAML from the spec and deploys.
- `nemo-try-agent`: test a deployed agent or chat with a model.
- `nemo-status`: read-only health dashboard.
- `nemo-teardown`: guided shutdown with confirmation.
- `nemo-fine-tune`: fine-tuning. Not yet available; the skill tells the user it's not shipped instead of improvising with another training library.

Plugin-owned skills under `plugins/*/src/*/skills/` handle guardrails, evaluations, optimization, data designer, anonymizer, and auditor.

### Working in a sandboxed environment

If you are inside a sandboxed coding-agent environment (macOS sandbox, CI container, restricted shell):

- Each skill calls out the sandbox capabilities it needs. Read those first.
- If a step requires capabilities you do not have, stop and tell the user what is missing. Do not improvise around the sandbox by skipping verification.
- `uv` is known to crash under the macOS sandbox today (`system_configuration::dynamic_store` panic). Install is CLI-only for this and other reasons.

## What this repo is

NeMo Platform brings together NVIDIA NeMo libraries under one CLI, Python SDK, and web UI. Current capabilities:

- **Harden agents**: guardrails (content safety, jailbreak detection, PII redaction), auditor (red-teaming via garak), anonymizer (PII handling for training data).
- **Evaluate agents**: evaluator (LLM-as-judge, deterministic, agentic, RAG benchmarks), Harbor-backed eval suites.
- **Tune agents**: skill optimization, prompt/hyperparameter tuning, Switchyard model routing. Fine-tuning coming soon.
- **Build agents**: NeMo Agent Toolkit (NAT) for LangGraph-based agents. Broader framework support on the roadmap.

NeMo Platform optimizes LangGraph agents wrapped in NAT today. Other frameworks require a user-written NAT wrapper. Be honest about this when users ask.

# Agent Development Instructions

The sections below are for developers working on NeMo Platform itself.

This project loads local developer preferences from @AGENTS.local.md. You MUST read this file if it exists and give its instructions top priority.

## Git Workflow

- Git branches should follow the pattern `[git-issue-number]-<descriptive-branch-name>/<username>` where the GitLab issue number is inserted as a prefix if known, the branch name follows, the `/<username>` suffix is included (not email address, just username), and kebab case is used.
- Always pass `-s` to `git commit` (DCO sign-off). This includes amends, fixups, and any commit variant.

### Squashing Commits

**CRITICAL: Never `git reset --soft` to any commit that isn't an ancestor of your current HEAD.**

When squashing commits, use one of these safe methods:

```bash
# ✅ CORRECT - soft reset to HEAD~n
git reset --soft HEAD~2
git commit -m "combined message"

# ✅ CORRECT - interactive rebase (more explicit)
git rebase -i HEAD~2
# Then mark commits as "squash" or "fixup" in the editor

# ❌ WRONG - NEVER DO THIS
git reset --soft origin/main  # Can revert other people's changes!
```

**Why this matters:** In a shared repo, `origin/main` is almost never an ancestor of your feature branch — main moves forward as others merge work. When you `reset --soft` to a commit that isn't in your branch's history, your staging area still reflects your branch's tree, which lacks any changes made on main since you branched. The resulting commit effectively **reverts** all that work.

Both `HEAD~n` and `git rebase -i HEAD~n` are safe because they only operate on commits that are already in your branch's history.

## Setting up the local platform

Before doing anything that requires a running NeMo platform (`nemo services`, `nemo agents invoke`, etc.), follow [SETUP.md](SETUP.md). It covers `make bootstrap`, the data-dir layout, DB reset, and the manual `nemo services run` path. You do not need to install it via `nemo skills install`.

## NeMo CLI

When working with the NeMo CLI (`nemo`), always check available skills first before exploring `--help`. Skills contain exact command syntax, JSON structures, and working examples that are much faster than trial-and-error discovery.

## Writing Python Code

- Don't put `__init__.py` files in packages. Instead prefer implicit namespace packages.

### Python Style notes

- Always prefer concrete type hints over string based ones. DO NOT import these types under TYPE_CHECKING. Instead prefer to import the types a regular import when possible.

### Python Package Management

- Use uv exclusively for Python package management in all projects.

#### Package Management Commands

- All Python dependencies **must be installed, synchronized, and locked** using uv
- Never use pip, pip-tools, poetry, or conda directly for dependency management

**Use these commands:**
- Install dependencies: `uv add <package>`
- Remove dependencies: `uv remove <package>`
- Sync dependencies: `uv sync`

#### Running Python Code

- Run a Python script with `uv run <script-name>.py`
- Run Python tools like Pytest with `uv run pytest` or `uv run ruff`
- Launch a Python repl with `uv run python`

### SDK Generation

The Python SDK is automatically generated from the OpenAPI specification using Stainless. The SDK is maintained in a separate Git repository and integrated into this project.

**Update the SDK:**
- `make update-sdk` - Full SDK update (regenerate OpenAPI spec + sync with Stainless)

**Individual steps:**
- `make refresh-openapi` - Regenerate OpenAPI spec from API definitions
- `make stainless` - Sync with Stainless (requires `STAINLESS_API_KEY` env var)

**When to regenerate the SDK:**
Regenerate the SDK whenever you modify:
- API endpoints (routes, methods, parameters, responses)
- Data models or schemas
- Files in these paths:
  - `packages/nmp_common/src/nmp_common/datamodel/`
  - `packages/nmp_common/src/nmp_common/api/`
  - Service API files: `services/*/src/*/api/`

**How it works:**
1. `refresh-openapi` generates `openapi/openapi.yaml` from your API code
2. `stainless` pushes the spec to Stainless API, which generates SDK code
3. Generated SDK is pulled from stainless remote and vendored packages are integrated
4. Post-generation updates apply licenses, README, and other metadata

**Note:** OpenAPI generation also runs as a pre-commit hook (manual stage) when API files change.

#### Testing Python Code

- When verifying solutions, prefer to write unit tests instead of executing python snippets.
- Don't put an `__init__.py` file in test directories. tests are not modules.

### Type Checking

Use the `ty` tool for type checking:
- Check all files: `uv run --frozen ty check`

Type checking runs automatically in CI via the `lint:uv` job.

### Linting

**Python Style (Ruff):**
- Lint all files: `uv run ruff check`
- Format check all files: `uv run ruff format --check`
- Lint single file: `uv run ruff check path/to/file.py`
- Format single file: `uv run ruff format path/to/file.py`

**Licenses:**
- Update and validate licenses: `make update-licenses`

**OpenAPI Spec:**
- Validate OpenAPI spec: `script/generate-openapi-spec.sh`
- Or use: `make refresh-openapi`

**SDK Validation:**
- Update SDK: `make update-sdk`

**OPA Policy:**
- Check policy WASM is up-to-date: `make check-policy`
- Build policy WASM: `make build-policy`

Linting runs automatically in CI via GitHub Actions in `.github/workflows/ci.yaml`; Studio web linting is covered by `.github/workflows/studio-ci.yaml`.

### Pre-commit Hooks

Pre-commit hooks run automatically before commits and pushes to ensure code quality. They can also be run manually.

**Run all hooks manually:**
- `uv run pre-commit run -a` - Run all pre-commit hooks

**What the hooks do:**
- **Ruff linter** - Automatically fixes linting issues in Python code (excludes SDK)
- **Ruff formatter** - Formats Python code (excludes SDK)
- **Type checking (ty)** - Runs type checks on Python code (may need manual fixes)
- **uv lock** - Automatically updates `uv.lock` when `pyproject.toml` changes
- **uv lock check** - Verifies `uv.lock` is in sync with `pyproject.toml`
- **Helm Docs Container** - Runs `helm-docs` container to regenerate Helm documentation in `deploy/helm/platform/README.md`
- **Check merge conflicts** - Detects merge conflict markers
- **OpenAPI generator** (manual stage) - Regenerates OpenAPI spec when API files change
- **Check policy WASM** (pre-push only) - Verifies OPA policy WASM is up-to-date

**Before attempting to commit:**
Ensure all pre-commit hooks pass by running `uv run pre-commit run -a`. A clean run (no changes) means you're ready to commit. Type checking errors may require manual fixes.

## Testing services

### Running Tests

**All tests:**
- All unit tests: `make test-unit`
- Integration tests: `make test-integration`
- All tests (unit + integration): `make test-all`

**Specific tests:**
- Specific service tests: `make test-unit-<service>` (e.g., `make test-unit-evaluator`)
- Specific package: `make test-package PACKAGE=<package_name>` (e.g., `make test-package PACKAGE=nmp_common`)
- Single test file: `uv run --frozen pytest path/to/test_file.py -v`
- Single test function: `uv run --frozen pytest path/to/test_file.py::test_function_name -v`

**Test utilities:**
- Watch mode (re-run on changes): `make test-watch`
- With coverage report: `make test-coverage` (generates HTML report in `htmlcov/index.html`)
- Debug mode: `make test-debug`
- Re-run failed tests: `make test-failed`

**Note:** E2E tests are currently disabled. Use `make test-unit` iteratively, then `make test-integration` for comprehensive verification.
