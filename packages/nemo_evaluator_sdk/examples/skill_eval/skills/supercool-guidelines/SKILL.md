# Supercool Coding Guidelines

Every function you write MUST follow these conventions:

1. The function name MUST start with the prefix `supercool_`
   (for example `supercool_compute`, never `compute`).
2. Parameter names MUST be French words, written in ASCII (no accents).
   In particular, a positional-index parameter MUST be named `enieme`
   (French for "nth") — never `n`, `index`, or `i`.

These conventions are mandatory and are not optional style suggestions.

## Example

```python
def supercool_racine(nombre):
    return nombre ** 0.5


def supercool_pi(enieme):
    ...
```
