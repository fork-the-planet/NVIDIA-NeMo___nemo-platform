"""Derive plugin authorization contributions from the ``NemoService`` route surface.

Plugins attach :func:`~nemo_platform_plugin.authz.path_rule` rules to route handlers,
referencing :class:`~nemo_platform_plugin.authz.Permission` constants. This module
instantiates each discovered ``NemoService``, walks its mounted routes — computing the
same ``/apis/<name>/<prefix>`` paths the platform mounts at runtime — reads the
function-attached :class:`~nemo_platform_plugin.authz.PathRule`\\ s, and builds the
wire-format :class:`~nemo_platform_plugin.authz.AuthzContribution` consumed by the OPA
bundle builder and ``auth-tools sync-plugins``.

The permission catalog (ids + descriptions) and the service namespace are derived
*entirely from the routes* (plus the optional :meth:`NemoService.extra_permissions`
hatch). There is no separately-declared permission list: the permission is the object
referenced on the route, and it carries its own description.

Path composition mirrors production: the platform runner mounts each service app at
``/apis/<service.name>`` and the service app includes each ``RouterSpec`` router at its
``prefix`` (see ``nmp.platform_runner.server`` and ``nmp.common.service.base``). We
re-create that composition with a throwaway router so FastAPI computes the final paths —
including prefix joins and ``{param:path}`` wildcards — exactly as it does at runtime.
