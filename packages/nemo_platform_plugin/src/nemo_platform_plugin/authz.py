"""Authorization policy for NeMo Platform plugins.

A plugin attaches :func:`path_rule` rules to its route handlers, referencing
:class:`Permission` objects from a typed :class:`PermissionSet`, and declares the route's
OAuth scope with ``@AuthzScope.read`` / ``@AuthzScope.write``. The platform derives
the normalized policy — the permission catalog (id + description), the per-endpoint
bindings, and the namespace — *entirely from the routes* (see
:mod:`nemo_platform_plugin.authz_discovery`) when the OPA bundle is built; it can also be
materialized into ``static-authz.yaml`` via ``auth-tools sync-plugins``.

The permission rule (callers + permissions) and the OAuth scope gate are independent
concerns, so they ride on the handler as two separate decorators: :func:`path_rule` and
``@AuthzScope.read``/``.write``. That keeps each declaration single-purpose and lets the
scope be read back and verified on its own (:func:`get_path_scope`).

There is no separate permission declaration to keep in sync: the permission *is* the
object referenced on the route, and it carries its own description. The only thing a
service declares apart from its routes is the optional escape hatch
:meth:`NemoService.extra_permissions` — for permissions that are not 1:1 with a route
(e.g. checked in middleware).

Example::

    from fastapi import APIRouter
    from nemo_platform_plugin.authz import AuthzScope, CallerKind, PermissionSet, path_rule, perm
    from nemo_platform_plugin.service import NemoService, RouterSpec

    scope = AuthzScope("example")

    class ExamplePerms(PermissionSet, namespace="example"):
        READ = perm("Read example items")  # -> Permission("example.read", ...)

    router = APIRouter()

    @router.get("/v2/workspaces/{workspace}/items/{name}")
    @scope.read
    @path_rule(callers=[CallerKind.PRINCIPAL], permissions=[ExamplePerms.READ])
    async def get_item(workspace: str, name: str) -> dict: ...

        name = "example"
