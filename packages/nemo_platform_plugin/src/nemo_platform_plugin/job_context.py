"""Runtime context handed to ``NemoJob.run()``.

Carries the non-client bits a job needs to execute: workspace, job id
(when one exists), filesystem paths, and a results sink. Each field
maps onto an existing ``NEMO_JOB_*`` environment variable that the
in-container runtime sets:

- ``workspace``         ← ``NEMO_JOB_WORKSPACE``
- ``job_id``            ← ``NEMO_JOB_ID`` (``None`` for local runs)
- ``storage.ephemeral``  ← ``NEMO_JOB_EPHEMERAL_TASK_STORAGE_PATH``
- ``storage.persistent`` ← ``NEMO_JOB_PERSISTENT_JOB_STORAGE_PATH``

Single sync class — there is no async twin. ``NemoJob.run`` runs in the
task container where there is no event loop and most work calls into
sync library protocols; ``ctx.results.save(...)`` is therefore sync as
well. This matches the shared resources/jobs/functions design rationale.

Clients (files, models, ...) reach the job via signature-based DI on
``run`` rather than through the context. Logging is not on the context
either — use ``logging.getLogger(__name__)`` in each task module.
Progress reporting is a virtual method on
:class:`~nemo_platform_plugin.job.NemoJob` so each job can ship its own payload
shape.

Example::

    def run(self, config: dict, *, ctx: JobContext, is_local: bool) -> dict:
        spec = MySpec.model_validate(config)
        out_path = ctx.storage.ephemeral / "rows.jsonl"
        ...
        ref = ctx.results.save("rows.jsonl", out_path)
        if not is_local:
            self.report_progress(ctx, status="done")
        return {"status": "completed", "result": ref.model_dump()}
