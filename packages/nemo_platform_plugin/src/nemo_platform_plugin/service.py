"""Plugin service interface — what plugin authors implement.

Plugin authors subclass :class:`NemoService` and register a module-level
instance under the ``nemo.services`` entry-point group.  The platform wraps
each instance in a :class:`NemoServiceAdapter` at startup so it can be
treated as a first-class internal :class:`~nmp.common.service.Service`.

Example::

    # my_plugin/service.py
    from fastapi import APIRouter
    from nemo_platform_plugin.service import NemoService, RouterSpec

    class MyService(NemoService):
        name = "my-plugin"
        dependencies = ["entities"]

        def get_routers(self) -> list[RouterSpec]:
            router = APIRouter()

            @router.get("/health")
            async def health() -> dict[str, str]:
                return {"status": "ok"}

            return [RouterSpec(router, tag="My Plugin")]

    # pyproject.toml:
    # [project.entry-points."nemo.services"]
    # my-plugin = "my_plugin.service:MyService"
