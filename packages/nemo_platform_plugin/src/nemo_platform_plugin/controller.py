"""Plugin controller interface — what plugin authors implement for reconcile loops.

Plugin authors subclass :class:`NemoController` and register a class under the
``nemo.controllers`` entry-point group.  The platform wraps each class in a
:class:`NemoControllerAdapter` at startup so it runs as a first-class singleton
background controller alongside the built-in models/entities/jobs controllers.

Example::

    # my_plugin/controller.py
    from nemo_platform_plugin.controller import NemoController

    class MyController(NemoController):
        name = "my-controller"
        dependencies = ["entities"]

        async def list_objects(self) -> list:
            return await self._entity_client.list(MyEntity, workspace="-")

        async def reconcile_one(self, obj: object) -> None:
            ...  # drive state machine for a single object

    # pyproject.toml:
    # [project.entry-points."nemo.controllers"]
    # my-controller = "my_plugin.controller:MyController"

Lifecycle
---------

The framework manages the reconcile loop:

1. Declared ``dependencies`` are polled via ``/status`` until each service is ready.
2. ``on_startup()`` is called once before the first reconcile cycle.
3. ``reconcile()`` is called repeatedly at ``interval_seconds`` intervals.
   The default implementation calls :meth:`list_objects` once per cycle and
   :meth:`reconcile_one` for each result with per-item error isolation.
4. On SIGINT/SIGTERM the platform sets a stop signal, waits for the current
   ``reconcile()`` call to complete, then calls ``on_shutdown()``.
   Controllers that override :meth:`reconcile` may call :meth:`stop_requested`
   between phases or per-item iterations to exit early during shutdown.

Plugin authors do **not** manage signals or threads — implement cleanup in
:meth:`on_shutdown` and the framework guarantees it is called after the last
reconcile cycle completes.
