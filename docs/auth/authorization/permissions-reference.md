# Permissions Reference

Complete reference of all permissions across the NeMo Platform APIs. Each permission controls access to a specific operation within an individual API. Permissions are assigned to users through [roles](roles-and-permissions.md).

For token-level access restrictions, see [API Scopes](api-scopes.md). For the RBAC model, see [Authorization Concepts](../concepts.md).

!!! note
    PlatformAdmin is omitted — it bypasses permission checks entirely at the policy level.
