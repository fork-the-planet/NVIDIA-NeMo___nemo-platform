# Tutorials

Learn how to run {{nss_short_name}} jobs through hands-on tutorials to generate private synthetic versions of sensitive tabular datasets. Each tutorial provides step-by-step guidance with executable code examples.

## Prerequisites

Before starting any tutorial, ensure you have:

- [{{nss_short_name}} deployed](../getting-started.md) using Docker Compose or Helm
- Python environment with `nemo-platform` SDK installed:
 ```bash
 pip install nemo-platform[all]
 ```
- Jupyter environment for running tutorial notebooks
