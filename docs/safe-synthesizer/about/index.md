# About Generating Safe Synthetic Data

{{nss_long_name}} enables you to create private versions of sensitive tabular datasets. The resulting data is entirely synthetic, with no one-to-one mapping to your original records. {{nss_short_name}} is purpose-built for privacy compliance and data protection while preserving data utility for downstream AI tasks.

{{nss_short_name}} allows you to generate synthetic data that maintains the statistical properties of your original dataset without exposing sensitive information about individual records.

{{nss_short_name}} is best when you have the data you need, but because it is private or sensitive in nature you cannot use it as-is. {{nss_short_name}} interpolates from existing data to generate a private, synthetic version, where new records have no one-to-one mapping to original records. If you do not have any data or want to extrapolate based on a very small set of examples, refer to [index](../../data-designer/index.md). NeMo Data Designer supports synthetic data creation from scratch or small seed for AI training and development use cases.

## {{nss_short_name}} Job

A complete {{nss_short_name}} job consists of the following steps:

1. [Upload Data](../../get-started/concepts/manage-files.md): Add your tabular data to the Files API
2. Prepare Data:
 - [Configure PII Replacement](pii-replacement.md): Set up detection and replacement of sensitive information (recommended prior to the Synthesis step to ensure the model has no chance of learning the most sensitive information like names and addresses)
 - Configure training data organization and holdout splits
3. Configure Synthesis:
 - [Training](data-synthesis.md): Set model selection and training parameters including differential privacy
 - Generate synthetic records
 - [Evaluation](evaluation.md): Assess quality and privacy
4. Execute and Review:
 - [Run and Monitor Job](jobs.md): Execute the job and track progress
 - Download synthetic data and evaluation reports

Find all Safe Synthesizer configuration parameters in [Parameters Reference](reference.md).
