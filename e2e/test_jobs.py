"""E2E tests for platform jobs.

These tests submit jobs with CPUExecutionProviderSpec (container + command).
The container image is omitted so that:
- On subprocess mode, the cpu→subprocess translation discards it anyway.
- On Kubernetes/Docker, the execution profile's default_task_image is used.

Ported from Platform-Deploy e2e/test_jobs.py, adapted for the SDK's TypedDict
param types and filtered to tests that work without Docker.
