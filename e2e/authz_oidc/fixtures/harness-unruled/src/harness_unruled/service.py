"""Partially-invalid fixture plugin for the authz OIDC E2E harness.

One route carries a valid ``@path_rule``; one deliberately does not. Under the
default ``on_invalid_plugin=deny_route`` fail mode (decision D4) the unruled
route must be explicitly denied for *every* caller — human with permissions,
service principal (``ServiceSystem`` wildcard), and PlatformAdmin — while the
ruled sibling keeps working. Under ``on_invalid_plugin=quarantine`` the whole
``/apis/harness-unruled`` namespace is fenced, ruled route included.
