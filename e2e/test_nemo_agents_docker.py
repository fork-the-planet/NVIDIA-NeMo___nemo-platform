"""E2E test for docker-mode agent deployments.

Unlike ``test_nemo_agents.py`` (backend-agnostic API/SDK surface, plus
subprocess-mode deployment coverage), this module deploys an agent as a real
**Docker container** through the nemo-deployments plugin and invokes it through
the agents gateway. The backend-agnostic deploy/invoke/assert core is shared
with the Kubernetes variant (``test_nemo_agents_k8s.py``) via
``e2e.agents_deploy_helpers``; this module owns only the docker-specific wiring.

What it proves — the container-mode chain end to end::

    sdk.agents.invoke (gateway proxy, container-mode endpoint resolution)
      -> docker agent container (nat start fastapi)
      -> Inference Gateway /openai (base_url injected at deploy time)
      -> mock provider short-circuit (no real upstream / no API key)
      -> response back through the gateway

How it runs, and where:

- The deployed agent runs from the platform's own ``nmp-api`` image, which
  already ships the NAT runtime (``nvidia-nat-core`` / ``nvidia-nat-langchain``,
  via ``nemo-agents-plugin``) — so ``nat`` is on ``PATH`` and the
  ``chat_completion`` workflow / ``openai`` LLM the agent uses resolve. The
  deployments docker executor overrides the image entrypoint with
  ``nat start fastapi``, so the image's own entrypoint is irrelevant. No
  agent-specific image is built.
- The image is supplied prebuilt via ``NMP_E2E_IMAGE_REGISTRY`` /
  ``NMP_E2E_IMAGE_TAG`` (the existing e2e convention). Its dedicated CI job
  (``python-e2e-image-test``) builds/pulls ``nmp-api`` and sets these; the
  ``needs_nmp_api_image`` marker skips the test everywhere they are unset (the
  plain subprocess e2e job, the kind cluster job, and local runs without them).
- The agent is registered with a deterministic single-LLM ``chat_completion``
  workflow served by the e2e mock inference provider, so no ``NVIDIA_API_KEY``
  or model egress is needed; we assert the exact mocked completion round-trips.
- The platform runs as a normal local process (subprocess harness). The
  ``container_base_url_host`` harness option makes the harness bind the platform
  on all interfaces (``--host 0.0.0.0``) and rewrite ``platform.base_url`` to the
  docker bridge address; the runner seeds ``NMP_BASE_URL`` from that host paired
  with the actual bind port, so the Inference Gateway URL injected into the agent
  container is reachable from *inside* the container while the platform's own
  in-process clients still reach it. This requires the Linux docker bridge, which
  is reachable from both the container and the host process; Docker Desktop's
  host alias is not host-resolvable, so the module skips on non-Linux.
