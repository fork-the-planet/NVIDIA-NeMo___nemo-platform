"""E2E test for Kubernetes-mode agent deployments.

The Kubernetes counterpart to ``test_nemo_agents_docker.py``: it deploys an
agent as a real **Kubernetes Deployment + Service** through the nemo-deployments
plugin and invokes it through the agents gateway. The backend-agnostic
deploy/invoke/assert core is shared via ``e2e.agents_deploy_helpers``; this
module owns only the k8s-specific wiring.

What it proves — the container-mode chain end to end, on Kubernetes::

    sdk.agents.invoke (gateway proxy, container-mode endpoint resolution)
      -> k8s agent pod (nat start fastapi), fronted by a ClusterIP Service
      -> Inference Gateway /openai (base_url injected at deploy time)
      -> mock provider short-circuit (no real upstream / no API key)
      -> response back through the gateway

How it runs, and where:

- This test only runs against an **external cluster** (``NMP_BASE_URL`` set) —
  i.e. the Kind CPU e2e CI job, where a Helm-deployed platform is configured
  with a nemo-deployments ``k8s`` executor (see ``e2e/k8s/values/kind.yaml``).
  The ``container_only`` marker skips it for the subprocess harness (local /
  plain e2e job), which is the inverse of the docker module's ``subprocess_only``.
- The agent runs from the platform's own ``nmp-api`` image, which already ships
  the NAT runtime and agent components (see the docker module docstring). The
  deployments k8s executor overrides the image entrypoint with ``nat start
  fastapi``. In CI the image is pre-pulled into the kind nodes and referenced by
  its commit-SHA tag, so the pod's default ``imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent`` uses
  the node-local image (the k8s backend does not use image pull secrets).
- The image ref is composed from ``NMP_E2E_IMAGE_REGISTRY`` /
  ``NMP_E2E_IMAGE_TAG`` (the existing e2e image convention). The
  ``needs_nmp_api_image`` marker skips the test unless both are set; the Kind
  CPU e2e job exports them from the built image outputs.
- The agent is registered with a deterministic single-LLM ``chat_completion``
  workflow served by the e2e mock inference provider, so no ``NVIDIA_API_KEY``
  or model egress is needed; we assert the exact mocked completion round-trips.
- Gateway reachability is in-cluster: the agent Deployment/Service land in the
  same namespace as the platform, and the Inference Gateway URL injected into
  the agent pod is the platform's own in-cluster ``NMP_BASE_URL``, reachable pod
  -> service. No docker-bridge / host-alias juggling is needed (that is a
  docker-in-a-local-process concern only), so this module has no Linux/OS skip.
