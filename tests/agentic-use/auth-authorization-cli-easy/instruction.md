# Authorization Flow (CLI)

You have access to the `nemo` CLI for NeMo Platform operations. Note: MCP tools are not available in this environment - you must use the CLI.

## Task

Complete the following authorization and role-based access control operations using the `nemo` CLI:

1. Create a workspace named `harbor-auth-test` with description `"Workspace for authorization testing"`
2. List the members of the workspace to confirm you (the workspace creator) are an Admin
3. Add a member `viewer@test.com` with the `Viewer` role to the workspace
4. Add a member `editor@test.com` with the `Editor` role to the workspace
5. Add a member `admin@test.com` with the `Admin` role to the workspace
6. List all members to verify all four members are present with correct roles
7. Update the role of `viewer@test.com` from `Viewer` to `Editor`
8. Delete member `editor@test.com` from the workspace
9. List members to confirm the final state

## Available CLI Commands

The `nemo` CLI is available at `/app/.venv/bin/nemo`. You can use these commands:

### Workspace Commands

- `nemo workspaces create <name> --description <description>` - Create a new workspace
- `nemo workspaces list` - List all workspaces
- `nemo workspaces get <name>` - Get a specific workspace
- `nemo workspaces delete <name>` - Delete a workspace

### Member Commands

All member commands operate on a workspace. Use `--workspace <name>` to specify the workspace.

- `nemo workspaces members create --principal <email> --roles <role> --workspace <workspace>` - Add a member with a role (Viewer, Editor, or Admin)
- `nemo workspaces members list --workspace <workspace>` - List all members and their roles
- `nemo workspaces members update <principal> --roles <role> --workspace <workspace>` - Update a member's role
- `nemo workspaces members delete <principal> --workspace <workspace>` - Remove a member

Note: The CLI connects to the local NeMo Platform API server at http://localhost:8080 by default.

## Success Criteria

The task is complete when:
- The workspace `harbor-auth-test` has been created
- You confirmed you are Admin of the workspace as its creator
- Members `viewer@test.com`, `editor@test.com`, and `admin@test.com` were added with their respective roles
- `viewer@test.com` was promoted from Viewer to Editor
- `editor@test.com` was removed from the workspace
- Final member list shows the creator as Admin, `viewer@test.com` as Editor, and `admin@test.com` as Admin (with `editor@test.com` removed)
