    Verify the agent executed all intermediate CRUD operations via CLI.

    Why this test exists:
    The tests above only verify final state (harbor-test-fileset deleted,
    harbor-final-fileset exists with verify.txt). But the task requires the agent
    to perform a full CRUD lifecycle on harbor-test-fileset: create it, upload a
    file, list files, download the file, delete the file, then delete the fileset.

    Since the filesets service does hard deletes with no audit trail, we cannot
    verify these intermediate operations via the API. Instead, we read the Claude
    Code session transcript to confirm the agent actually executed all the required
    CLI commands.
