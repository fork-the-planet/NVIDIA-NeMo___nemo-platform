    Verify the agent executed all intermediate CRUD operations via CLI.

    Why this test exists:
    The tests above only verify final state (harbor-audit-target deleted,
    harbor-audit-target-final exists). But the task requires the agent to
    perform a full CRUD lifecycle on harbor-audit-target: create it, list
    targets, get it by name, update its description, then delete it.

    Since the auditor service does hard deletes with no audit trail, we
    cannot verify these intermediate operations via the API. Instead, we
    read the Claude Code session transcript to confirm the agent actually
    executed all the required CLI commands.
