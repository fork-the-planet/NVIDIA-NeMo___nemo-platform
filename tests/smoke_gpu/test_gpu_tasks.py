"""GPU task image import smoke tests.

Built as part of the docker-gpu bake group (smoke-test stage) and run on a CPU
runner — no GPU hardware required.

Two failure classes are caught at .so load time, before any GPU device is touched:

  ModuleNotFoundError  — package missing from the image (e.g. excluded from
                         a tar layer without a compensating COPY command)

  ImportError          — CUDA extension .so has an undefined symbol; the wheel
                         was compiled against a different PyTorch version than
                         the one installed (ABI mismatch)
